    <p>The Porsche 911 has been dominating on and off the track for over half of a century. It's gone from being victorious in some of the most iconic races like <a href= "https://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/24-hours-of-le-mans-porsches-19-wins-with-six-legendary-cars-54677" target="_blank"> 24 Hour Le Mans in France </a> to taking to being one of the most popular vehicles among celebrities and anyone who can afford them. </p>

    <p>It's proven to be such a versatile vehicle that Ferry Porsche Jr. described it as "the only car with which one can go on African Safari, run the 24 Hour Le Mans, head to the theatre or drive the streets of New York.> </p>
